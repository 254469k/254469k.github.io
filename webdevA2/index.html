    <h1>Badminton Footwork</h1>

    <p>
      Badminton footwork is a critical foundation of the game that supports every stroke and movement on the court.
      Unlike raw power or technical shots alone, effective footwork allows players to position themselves optimally to
      strike the shuttle with precision, speed, and balance. It involves a coordinated series of steps, lunges, jumps,
      and
      turns that help players transition smoothly between offensive and defensive plays.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without proper footwork, even skilled players may struggle to reach the shuttle in time or lose balance while
      executing a shot,
      leading to unforced errors. Good footwork not only improves reaction time and shot accuracy but also reduces
      fatigue
      by promoting efficient movement. Whether you're attacking from the backcourt or intercepting a net shot, mastering
      footwork
      gives you the physical and strategic edge in every rally.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below are the most common footwork techniques used in different zones of the court, each with its own specific
      purpose
      to help players move faster, stay balanced, and recover quickly for the next shot.
    </p>

    <h2>Split Step</h2>
    <div class="general-flex">
      <div class="general-text">
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Prepares the body to move in any direction instantly.</p>
        <p><strong>How:</strong> Just before your opponent hits the shuttle, perform a small jump and land with both
          feet shoulder-width apart, knees bent, and body weight centered.</p>
        <p><strong>When to Use:</strong> Before reacting to your opponent's shot — it's a reset position used
          continuously during play.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Lunge</h2>
    <div class="general-flex">
      <div class="general-text">
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Reach low or net shots quickly while staying stable.</p>
        <p><strong>How:</strong> Step forward firmly with one leg bent, keeping the back leg extended. Ensure your upper
          body stays upright for balance.</p>
        <p><strong>When to Use:</strong> When returning net drops or short front-court shots.</p>

      <div class="general-text">
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Rapidly cover longer distances.</p>
        <p><strong>How:</strong> Cross one leg over the other while sprinting toward a far court position. Rotate your
          body as needed to stay aligned.</p>
        <p><strong>When to Use:</strong> To chase deep clears or smashes toward the backcourt.</p>

    <h2>Side Step</h2>
    <div class="general-flex">
      <div class="general-text">
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Move sideways efficiently while maintaining balance and court awareness.</p>
        <p><strong>How:</strong> Keep knees bent and body low while stepping to the side without crossing your feet.
          Maintain a ready stance with arms in front.</p>
        <p><strong>When to Use:</strong> When shifting laterally to intercept shots or return to center after a wide
          shot.</p>

    <h1>Badminton Techniques</h1>

    <p>
      Badminton techniques are essential skills that allow players to effectively control the shuttle, dictate the pace
      of the game, and respond to various in-game situations. These techniques include offensive, defensive, and
      tactical shots such as the smash, drop shot and net shot. Developing these skills not only improves a
      player's agility and accuracy but also enhances their ability to outmaneuver opponents strategically.
    </p>

    <h2>Smash</h2>
    <div class="general-flex">
      <div class="general-text">
        <p>
          The smash is one of the most powerful and aggressive shots in badminton. It involves hitting the shuttle
          sharply
          downwards from a high position, usually from the back of the court. A well-executed smash travels at high
          speed
          and is difficult for opponents to return, especially when aimed at their body or the corners of the court.
          Smashes
          are commonly used to end rallies or force weak returns.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are variations of smashes, such as the jump smash (for more power and angle) and half-smash (for better
          control). Players should focus on timing, wrist snap, and footwork to maximize the effectiveness of this shot.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="general-image">
        <img src="images/smash.jpg" alt="Badminton Smash" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Drop Shot</h2>
    <div class="general-flex">
      <div class="general-text">
        <p>
          A drop shot is a soft and deceptive stroke played from the back or mid-court that lands just over the net in
          the
          opponent's front court. It's used to disrupt the opponent’s rhythm by forcing them to move forward quickly.
          Unlike
          a smash, which relies on power, the drop shot relies on finesse, precision, and disguise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drop shots can be either slow (gently falling close to the net) or fast (falling slightly deeper but still
          forcing
          a forward move). Combining drop shots with smashes can keep your opponent guessing and create space for more
          attacking opportunities.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="general-image">
        <img src="images/drop.jpg" alt="Badminton Drop Shot" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Net Shot</h2>
    <div class="general-flex">
      <div class="general-text">
        <p>
          A net shot is played very close to the net and is used when both players are near the front of the court. The
          goal
          is to return the shuttle just over the net, making it land as close as possible to the other side. This forces
          your opponent to play a lift (a shot to the back court), giving you the chance to attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Good net shots require a delicate touch and precise control to keep the shuttle low and tight to the net. A
          spinning net shot adds an extra layer of difficulty for the opponent, as the shuttle tumbles unpredictably,
          making it harder to hit back cleanly.

    <h1>History of Badminton</h1>

    <p>
      Badminton's origins can be traced back over 2,000 years to ancient civilizations in Greece, China, and India,
      where games involving shuttlecocks were played. The modern version of the sport began to take shape in British
      India during the mid-19th century. British army officers stationed in Pune (then known as Poona) encountered a
      local game called "Poona," which involved hitting a shuttlecock back and forth using rackets. They introduced this
      game to England, where it gained popularity among the British elite.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sport was named after Badminton House in Gloucestershire, the ancestral home of the Duke of Beaufort, where it
      was first played in England. The Bath Badminton Club, established in 1877, was pivotal in formalizing the rules of
      the game. The first official badminton competition, the All England Open Badminton Championships, was held in
      1899.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1934, the International Badminton Federation (IBF) was founded with nine member nations. The IBF later became
      the Badminton World Federation (BWF) in 2006. Badminton was introduced as a demonstration sport at the 1972 Munich
      Olympics and became an official Olympic sport at the 1992 Barcelona Games.
    </p>

    <h2>Shuttlecock</h2>
    <div class="general-flex">
      <div class="general-text">
        <p>
          The shuttlecock, also known as a birdie, is central to badminton and has a unique design that influences
          gameplay. Traditionally, shuttlecocks were handmade using 16 goose feathers embedded into a rounded cork base,
          offering a precise aerodynamic flight. Today, professional shuttlecocks still follow this feathered design,
          though synthetic versions exist for recreational play. The evolution of the shuttlecock combines craftsmanship
          and scientific understanding, ensuring consistent flight patterns and durability, which are critical for
          competitive badminton.

    <h2>Badminton Racket</h2>
    <div class="general-flex">
      <div class="general-text">
        <p>
          Early badminton rackets were crafted from wood with natural gut strings, which limited their durability and
          power. As the sport evolved, metal rackets made from steel and aluminum were introduced, providing stronger
          frames but with increased weight. The modern era of badminton rackets began with the use of carbon fiber and
          graphite composites, creating ultra-lightweight, strong, and flexible rackets. This technological progress has
          enhanced player control, speed, and power, allowing faster shots and better maneuverability on the court.
